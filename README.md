# UMN League of Legends Club - Automated Standings

## Overview
This project aims to provide the University of Minnesota (UMN) League of Legends Club with an (almost fully) automated system for updating their weekly standings based on replay data. The system utilizes Nuxt.js for the frontend, a C# script for parsing replay data, and PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.

## Features
- Automatic parsing and updating of replay data into the PostgreSQL database.
- Dynamic frontend built with Nuxt.js to display updated standings.
- Integration with Supabase for database hosting and management.

## Installation
- TODO: Since setting up this project is a bit of a large task I will create a good tutorial later instead of a useless one now.

## Usage
- Access the frontend application by navigating to the provided URL.
- Upload replay files to the admin dash board and then run the C# script.
- Monitor the standings page for real-time updates based on the parsed replay data.
